	<h1>Mommy Takes the Cat Back</h1>
	<p>So mommy realized that keeping that cat was doing no good to anyone in the household, and that makes perfect sense since this is my household. So mommy picked up the cat and took him back to adoption center. I am sure he will find a good home, where he can be the boss there.</p>
