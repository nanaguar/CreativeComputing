	<h1>So Mommy Chose To Bring a Puppy Home</h1>
	<p>If I am going to be quite honest with you all when this tiny fur ball arrived, Balu, I was confused by the smell. I have been "exposed" to dogs ever since I was a Kitten. My grandparents have two dogs, and we have a playdates all the time. But lets be real since I am "The Master Cat" I had make a strong impression at the beginning. I must say, I didn't hiss or ignore, but I did set that puppy in his place.</p>
